## üß† IMPORTANT: How to Set Up The Macro

### Scan Area

SillySeal++ detects fish in a specific rectangular screen region where the fishing minigame occurs.

To set it up correctly:
1. **Open Be a Silly Seal in Roblox** and start the fishing minigame.
2. **Use your screen snipping tool** or reference your resolution (1920x1080 by default).
3. **Adjust the detection area values in the `bar_area.ini` file**, which is automatically created the first time you run the app with default settings based on a 1920x1080 windowed setup on Windows 11 (100% scale).

The default `bar_area.ini` will look like this:
```ini
[DetectionArea]
left = 728
top = 746
right = 1229
bottom = 812
````
If your game window or resolution differs, modify these values accordingly to ensure accurate fish detection. The scan area values should match the highlighted area in the following image example:  
![Selection Example](assets/selection_example.png)

### Color Detection

If the macro **fails to detect fish**, or **detects incorrect objects** (like the red bar at the left of the minigame), you may need to **adjust the color tolerance** setting.

Open the `bar_area.ini` file and locate this value:

```ini
[Settings]
color_tolerance = 1
```

* üîº **Increase this number** (e.g. `2`, `5`, or `8`) if **fish aren‚Äôt being detected**. This allows more flexibility when matching fish colors that may appear slightly different due to lighting or screen effects.
* üîΩ **Decrease this number** (e.g. `0` or `1`) if the macro is **detecting non-fish objects**. This makes the detection stricter, only allowing near-exact color matches.

> Setting the tolerance too high may cause the macro to click on incorrect targets.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Usage

* Hover your mouse over the fishing prompt.
* Press <kbd>F6</kbd> to start or stop the macro.
* The macro will auto-detect red/blue fish and do the clicking for you.
* To exit manually, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> in the console window.
